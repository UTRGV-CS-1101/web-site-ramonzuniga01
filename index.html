    <h2 class="title">Fun Fact 1: I like to play Soccer</h2>
    <p class="message">Soccer has been apart of my journey since I was 3 years old. Its been my pride and joy. I am grateful for all that soccer has taught and given me. Hopefully one day I could give back to soccer by maybe teaching my kid or being a coach or something. But til then I will focus on my career and make the best of it.</p>

    <h2 class="title">Fun Fact 2: My major is Computer Science</h2>
    <p class="message">As college approached I never really knew what I wanted to major in. My mom ultimately inspired me to go into this field. It had me interested in learning more. I never really tried or looked into it. I am excited to see what I learn and get out of computer science.  </p>
